Alexander Bobb's Blackjack site. I have created a site where you can play Blackjack for free.
To run navigate into the src directory then run: 'node app.js'.
Open chrome and type in the url: 'localhost:3000'. 
Once there you can choose start values or click the play button to have random cards generated.
Once game is complete you can refresh to play again.
